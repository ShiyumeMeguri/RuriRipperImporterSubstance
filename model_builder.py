"""Turn a resolved Unity prefab (or a lone Mesh asset) into one GLB that
Substance Painter can open, plus the material table the texture/shader stage
then wires up.

This is the Painter-side twin of the Blender addon's prefab_importer: same
renderer discovery, same LOD0/shadow-proxy filtering, same bind-pose bake --
only the output differs (a glTF primitive per submesh instead of a Blender
object per renderer), because Painter's entry point is a mesh file rather than
a scene graph.

Every Texture Set Painter ends up with is named after a Unity material's own
``m_Name``, since that is the identity the shader/texture wiring keys off; the
mapping from that name back to the material document is returned alongside the
file so no later stage ever has to re-derive it from a filename.
